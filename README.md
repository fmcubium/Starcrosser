# Starcrosser

The size and properties of interstellar space are often incorrectly perceived or understood, as a result of our struggle with comprehending extremely large or small things. Our goal is to build a program that helps users visualize extremely large distances in space, particularly between observed star systems.

## Description

This project uses an adjacency list implementation of a graph, which then allows users to select ways to traverse from one star to another. 

### Data Structure
```cpp
class Graph {
	//These maps will make up our graph
	map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>> data;
};

```
 > Using a map will allow for easy access to each star, and their adjacent stars.
